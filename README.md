# Creating a TicTacToe game using PyGame

TLDR: TicTacToe but bigger and a little bit more difficult to win

Slightly longer instruction:
  - 2 players take turns to make their move.
  - The game ends when one player has 5 pieces in a row (whether it is horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).
  - However, if those 5 pieces are directly sandwiched between 2 pieces of the opponent, those 5 pieces won't count and the game will continue. (This feature has not yet been implemented)
