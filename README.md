# Creating a TicTacToe game using PyGame

How to Play:
- 2 players take turns to make their move.
- Winning Condition: When one player has 5 pieces in a row (whether it is horizontal, vertical, or diagonal), that player wins the game. However, there are 2 exceptions:
  1. If those 5 pieces are directly sandwiched between 2 pieces of the opponent, those 5 pieces won't be counted and the game will continue. (This feature has not yet been implemented)
  2. If the player have 6 or more pieces in a row, all of them won't be counted and the game will continue
TLDR: TicTacToe but bigger and a tad bit more difficult to win
